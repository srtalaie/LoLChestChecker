# LoLChestChecker
Web tool to see which champs you have acquired a chest for during the current season.

This is a little web tool I created so I can quickly check which champs I have gotten chests for in champ select during ARAM as there is no way to see. Utilizes Riot's API and Jquery to provide the data. For the front end I use flexbox so it can be optimized for varying screen sizes.
